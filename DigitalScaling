Stephen,
As your document says, 
Fundamentally, this 0-1023 range is converted to 0-255 ( by multiplying by the conversion factor 255/1023) and sent to the motors. 
That is the same as saying that we divide by 4.
In my office last week, we imnplemented divid-by-four using noeht erfloating-point division, not integer division, but by shifting the binary value two places to the right.
So a value in the range 0 to 1023 would be a value in the range 0000:0000 to 0011:1111:1111
SHift that right by two places, we divide by four. that becomes
0000:0000 to 1111:1111 (or 0 to 255)
So, to convert the analog voltage on one of the Ax pins, we shift right by  2 places
Steeering = AnalogRead(A0) // Read the steering position
Steering = Steering >> 2; // divide it by 4
If we wanted to write thjat to something, we could do AnalogWrite(Steering) to one of the PWM pins.
Bu, in that case, ewr con't be sending it straight to a pin.
In the case of the throttle, it is a lot easier, because, by dfefault, we will be sending that to the motors.
In the fist instance, the moptors will both be sent the same PWM value, later we need to look at differential steering etc.
